# Crypto UI Project

This is a simple front-end UI project designed for a fictional cryptocurrency website.  
The project does **not include any dynamic actions or backend logic** — it is purely static and implemented using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 💡 Project Description

The interface showcases a list of cryptocurrencies along with basic details such as their names, symbols, volume, and trend direction.  
All the data is **hardcoded** and used solely for layout and styling purposes.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 📁 Project Purpose

This project was developed during my front-end internship at **Esfahan Ahan Company** as part of a training period to practice basic UI design and layout techniques.
